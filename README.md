# code-fanatic


Hello there!

This is my first website while learning full-stack web development. I thought it would be nice if I upload my code in GitHub and could see if this can work as a fully-fletched functional website. I will appreciate all opinions on how to make my way of interacting with code more interesting. So, hit me up anytime as maneekantas1965@gmail.com. 

Thank you.
